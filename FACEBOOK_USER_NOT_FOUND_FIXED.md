# 🔧 Facebook OAuth "User not found" Error - FIXED

## ✅ **Issue Identified and Fixed**

### **Problem:**
```json
{"detail":"User not found"}
```

### **Root Cause:**
The OAuth callback was trying to look up a user with an **email address** (`"demo@mumbai.com"`) but the `get_user()` method expects a **username** (`"demo"`).

### **Technical Details:**
```python
# In /connect endpoint - BEFORE:
test_user_id = "demo@mumbai.com"  # ❌ This is an email

# In /callback endpoint:
user = await user_repo.get_user(oauth_state.user_id)  # ❌ Expects username, got email

# User repository has:
username: "demo"           # ✅ This is what get_user() expects  
email: "demo@mumbai.com"   # ❌ This is what we were storing
id: "demo-user-1"          # Alternative option
```

### **Solution Applied:**
```python
# In /connect endpoint - AFTER:
test_user_id = "demo"  # ✅ Use username instead of email
await agent_repo.store_oauth_state(state, test_user_id)
```
