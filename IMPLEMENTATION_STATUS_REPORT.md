## 🔍 **CURRENT ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### 1. **Property Form Validation**
**Issue**: Users reporting "please fill all required properties" error
**Analysis**: The validation logic checks for `address`, `price`, and `property_type` - all fields exist in the form
**Next Steps**: Need to test with actual user input to identify root cause

### 2. **Test Cases Need Updates** 
**Issue**: Playwright tests failing due to structure changes
**Root Cause**: Tests expect `h2` elements with "Step X of 7" format, but page uses `h3` without that text
**Status**: Tests need to be updated to match current onboarding structure

## 🎯 **STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (This Week)**
1. **Test Property Form**: Debug the validation issue with real user testing
2. **Update Test Cases**: Fix Playwright tests to match new 7-step structure
3. **User Testing**: Get feedback on RERA compliance fields
