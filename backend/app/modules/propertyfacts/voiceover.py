"""The voice-over step: the marketing run makes its reels with our music only; a reel's voice is asked for afterwards, one
reel at a time from Studio, in Hinglish, English or Marathi, a female or a male voice (owner, 2026-10-16: the voice is the
last step, made on demand; Google's Chirp 3 HD on the server's key, no Gemini).

It talks like a person showing a project to friends, not like an ad read:
  opening  the host's greeting and who shows what, written by code, never by a model ("Namaskar dosto! Aaj Avasetu ki team
           aapko dikha rahi hai Lodha Camelot, Lohegaon."), the greeting rotated per reel so a campaign's reels do not open
           alike; no time of day (a reel goes out at another hour than it is made). "dikha rahi hai" agrees with "team", so it
           is right whoever speaks.
  lines    the model says each screen line the way a person talks over that picture: short sentences, the small spoken words
           of the language ("dekhiye", "matlab", "बघा") and pause tags ([pause short] before a price, [pause] between two
           thoughts). A line is kept only when it keeps to its screen line's facts (ad_reel.said_ok on the line without its
           tags); otherwise the screen line itself is read (ad_reel.spoken).
  voice    each line one Chirp 3 HD request (reels.voice.synth_spoken), a little slower than a read; "Avasetu" is said
           a-va-SAY-too and Pune's names as Pune says them (voice.NAMES).
The caption then opens with the same greeting in writing (Script.intro)."""
