"""Priority 1: Smart CRM & Lead Management System - Technical Specification"""

# PRIORITY 1: SMART CRM & LEAD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
# ==============================================

## Executive Summary
Build an intelligent lead management system that helps real estate agents convert more leads through AI-powered insights, automated follow-ups, and seamless workflow management.

## User Stories & Requirements

### Epic 1: Lead Intelligence
**As an agent, I want AI to help me prioritize leads so I focus on the most promising prospects.**

#### User Stories:
1. **Lead Scoring**
   - As an agent, I want each lead to have an AI-generated score (1-100) so I know which ones to call first
   - As an agent, I want to see why a lead got a high/low score so I can understand the reasoning
   - As an agent, I want the scoring to improve over time based on my actual conversions

2. **Lead Insights**
   - As an agent, I want to see AI-generated insights about each lead (budget range, urgency, preferences)
   - As an agent, I want conversation summaries from all touchpoints (comments, messages, calls)
   - As an agent, I want recommended next actions for each lead

#### Technical Requirements:
```python
# Lead scoring algorithm inputs:
- Source quality (Facebook comment vs direct inquiry)
- Message content analysis (urgency keywords, specific questions)
- Response time to agent outreach
- Engagement level (likes, shares, multiple comments)
- Profile analysis (job, location, family status if available)
- Time of inquiry (business hours vs off-hours)
- Property price vs typical local budgets

# AI Scoring Model:
class LeadScoringEngine:
    def calculate_score(self, lead: Lead) -> LeadScore:
        # Weighted scoring algorithm
        content_score = self.analyze_message_content(lead.initial_message)
        source_score = self.evaluate_lead_source(lead.source)
        engagement_score = self.measure_engagement_level(lead.interactions)
        timing_score = self.analyze_inquiry_timing(lead.created_at)
        profile_score = self.analyze_user_profile(lead.facebook_profile)
        
        weighted_score = (
            content_score * 0.3 +
            source_score * 0.2 +
            engagement_score * 0.25 +
            timing_score * 0.1 +
            profile_score * 0.15
        )
        
        return LeadScore(
            score=int(weighted_score),
            factors=self.explain_scoring_factors(),
            confidence=self.calculate_confidence_level()
        )
```

### Epic 2: Automated Follow-ups
**As an agent, I want automated follow-up sequences so I never miss following up with a lead.**

#### User Stories:
1. **Smart Sequences**
   - As an agent, I want to set up follow-up sequences that trigger based on lead behavior
   - As an agent, I want AI to suggest the best follow-up message based on the lead's previous responses
   - As an agent, I want different sequences for different lead types (hot, warm, cold)

2. **Multi-Channel Follow-ups**
   - As an agent, I want to follow up via WhatsApp, email, and calls in a coordinated sequence
   - As an agent, I want the system to respect do-not-disturb hours and preferences
   - As an agent, I want to track which channels work best for different lead types

#### Technical Requirements:
```python
# Follow-up sequence engine
class FollowUpEngine:
    def create_sequence(self, lead: Lead, template_type: str) -> FollowUpSequence:
        # AI-generated personalized sequence
        sequence_steps = [
            FollowUpStep(
                delay_hours=2,
                channel="whatsapp",
                message=self.generate_followup_message(lead, step=1),
                conditions=["no_response_to_initial"]
            ),
            FollowUpStep(
                delay_hours=24,
                channel="call",
                action="schedule_call",
                conditions=["whatsapp_delivered", "no_response"]
            ),
            FollowUpStep(
                delay_hours=72,
                channel="email",
                message=self.generate_property_brochure(lead.property_interest),
                conditions=["call_not_answered"]
            )
        ]
        return FollowUpSequence(steps=sequence_steps)

# WhatsApp Business API Integration
class WhatsAppService:
    async def send_message(self, phone: str, message: str, template_name: str = None):
        # Integration with WhatsApp Business API
        pass
    
    async def send_media(self, phone: str, media_url: str, caption: str):
        # Send property images/videos
        pass
```

### Epic 3: Mobile-First Interface
**As an agent, I want a mobile app that lets me manage leads while I'm showing properties.**

#### User Stories:
1. **Lead Dashboard**
   - As an agent, I want to see my leads organized by priority and status on my phone
   - As an agent, I want to quickly call/WhatsApp leads directly from the app
   - As an agent, I want to update lead status and add notes while on the go

2. **Quick Actions**
   - As an agent, I want to send property details to a lead with one tap
   - As an agent, I want to schedule follow-up reminders while talking to a client
   - As an agent, I want to mark leads as "hot" when they show strong interest

#### Technical Requirements:
```typescript
// React Native mobile app structure
interface LeadDashboard {
  hotLeads: Lead[];
  warmLeads: Lead[];
  coldLeads: Lead[];
  todayFollowUps: FollowUp[];
  overdueFollowUps: FollowUp[];
}

// Quick action components
const QuickActions = {
  SendPropertyDetails: (leadId: string, propertyId: string) => void,
  ScheduleCall: (leadId: string, datetime: Date) => void,
  UpdateStatus: (leadId: string, status: LeadStatus) => void,
  AddNote: (leadId: string, note: string) => void,
  SendWhatsApp: (phone: string, message: string) => void
}
```
