## üö® **Risk Management**

### **High-Risk Items:**

#### **1. Form Submission Logic Changes**
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Impact**: Could break property creation
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, feature flags, gradual rollout
- **Owner**: @frontend-dev
- **Timeline**: Week 2-3

#### **2. API Schema Modifications**
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Impact**: Could break existing integrations
- **Mitigation**: Backward compatibility, versioning, migration utilities
- **Owner**: @backend-dev
- **Timeline**: Week 2-3

#### **3. User Experience Changes**
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Impact**: Could confuse users
- **Mitigation**: A/B testing, user feedback, gradual rollout
- **Owner**: @ux-designer
- **Timeline**: Week 3

### **Contingency Plans:**

#### **Rollback Strategy:**
```typescript
// Feature flags for instant rollback
const FEATURE_FLAGS = {
  USE_UNIFIED_FORM: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_UNIFIED_FORM === 'true',
  FALLBACK_ON_ERROR: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FALLBACK_ON_ERROR === 'true'
}

// Automatic fallback on errors
if (error && FEATURE_FLAGS.FALLBACK_ON_ERROR) {
  return <LegacyPropertyForm />
}
```

#### **Monitoring Strategy:**
```typescript
// Real-time error monitoring
Sentry.captureException(error, {
  tags: {
    component: 'UnifiedPropertyForm',
    variant: variant.type,
    user_id: currentUser.id
  }
})

// Performance monitoring
performance.mark('form-start')
// ... form logic
performance.mark('form-end')
performance.measure('form-duration', 'form-start', 'form-end')
```
