# Product Owner Progress Tracker

Date: 2025-08-15

## Scope Delivered
- Login and Dashboard (HTML UI)
- Leads list/create (MongoDB)
- Properties list/create (MongoDB)
- Facebook actions (mocked)

## Fixes Today
- Fixed UI console errors (invalid newline token; openModal not defined)
- Converted API endpoints to support MongoDB mode
- Added Docker setup (Mongo + CRM) and CI smoke tests

## Next
- Finish deduping HTML blocks inside complete_production_crm.py
- Expand Playwright coverage (CRUD flows)
- Add env templates and docs for Docker run

## Risks
- Large monolith file makes future edits error-prone
- Inline scripts can regress if not escaped correctly
